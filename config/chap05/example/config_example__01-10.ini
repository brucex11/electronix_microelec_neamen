 Objective: Calculate the base, collector, and emitter currents and the
 C-E voltage for a common-emitter circuit. Calculate the transistor power
 dissipation.
 For the circuit shown in Figure 5.19(a), the parameters are: VBB = 4V,
 RB = 220k, RC = 2k, VCC = 10V, VBE(on) = 0.7V, and Beta = 200.

 Comment: Since VBB > VBE (on) and VCE > VBE (on), the transistor is indeed
 biased in the forward-active mode. As a note, in an actual circuit, the voltage across
 a B-E junction may not be exactly 0.7V, as we have assumed using the piecewise
 linear approximation. This may lead to slight inaccuracies between the calculated
 currents and voltages and the measured values. Also note that, if we take the difference
 between IE and IC , which is the base current, we obtain IB = 20uA rather than
 15uA. The difference is the result of roundoff error in the emitter current."

 ANS: IB = 15uA, IC = 3mA, IE = 3.02mA, PT ~= 12mW."
