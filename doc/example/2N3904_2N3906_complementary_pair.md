The **complementary PNP BJT** to the **2N3904** (which is an NPN transistor) is the **2N3906**.

### Explanation:

- **2N3904**: This is a widely used **NPN transistor**. It is a general-purpose, low-power BJT that can be used in switching and amplification applications.
  
- **2N3906**: This is the **complementary PNP transistor** to the 2N3904. It has similar electrical characteristics but operates in the opposite direction (with PNP type characteristics, where the current flows from the emitter to the base and from the collector to the base).

So, the **2N3906** is the **PNP counterpart** of the **2N3904**, and they are often used together in complementary push-pull configurations, such as in audio amplification circuits or other balanced applications.

### Key Differences:

- **2N3904 (NPN)**:
  - **Base-emitter voltage**: typically around 0.7V (positive voltage for turn-on).
  - **Current flow**: From **collector to emitter** (current flows from the collector to the base and from the emitter to the base).
  
- **2N3906 (PNP)**:
  - **Base-emitter voltage**: typically around -0.7V (negative voltage for turn-on).
  - **Current flow**: From **emitter to collector** (current flows from the emitter to the base and from the collector to the base).

These two transistors, 2N3904 (NPN) and 2N3906 (PNP), can be paired in various circuits for balanced performance, like in **push-pull amplifier designs**.
