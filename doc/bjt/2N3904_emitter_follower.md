The output resistance of a typical **emitter follower** (also known as a **common collector**) configuration using a **2N3904** transistor biased in the active region can be approximated by considering the following key factors:

### 1. **Small-Signal Model for Emitter Follower**:
The output resistance of an emitter follower is mainly determined by the **internal resistance** of the transistor and any **external resistances** in the circuit, such as the load resistor \( R_L \). In the small-signal model, the output resistance is influenced by the **dynamic resistance of the emitter** and the **resistance seen from the collector** looking into the transistor.

### 2. **Small-Signal Parameters**:
For the **2N3904** transistor, the small-signal parameters like the transconductance \( g_m \) and the intrinsic emitter resistance \( r_e \) are important in calculating the output resistance.

- The **transconductance** \( g_m \) is given by:
  
  \[
  g_m = \frac{I_C}{V_T}
  \]
  
  Where:
  - \( I_C \) is the collector current (in amperes).
  - \( V_T \) is the thermal voltage, approximately **26 mV** at room temperature.

- The **emitter resistance** \( r_e \) is approximately:

  \[
  r_e \approx \frac{V_T}{I_C}
  \]

  Where:
  - \( I_C \) is the quiescent collector current.

### 3. **Output Resistance Formula**:
The output resistance \( R_{out} \) for a common-collector (emitter follower) configuration is approximately:

\[
R_{out} \approx \frac{r_e}{1 + \beta}
\]

Where:
- \( r_e \) is the intrinsic emitter resistance.
- \( \beta \) is the current gain of the transistor, which for the **2N3904** is typically between **100 and 300**.

### 4. **Typical Output Resistance**:
- For a typical operating point where the **collector current \( I_C \)** is around **1 mA**, the small-signal emitter resistance \( r_e \) would be approximately:

  \[
  r_e = \frac{V_T}{I_C} = \frac{26 \, \text{mV}}{1 \, \text{mA}} = 26 \, \Omega
  \]

- If \( \beta \) is assumed to be around **100**, then:

  \[
  R_{out} \approx \frac{26 \, \Omega}{1 + 100} \approx \frac{26 \, \Omega}{101} \approx 0.257 \, \Omega
  \]

This shows that the output resistance of the emitter follower is quite low, typically in the range of a few **ohms**.

### 5. **Practical Considerations**:
- The output resistance can be slightly affected by external factors, such as emitter degeneration resistors, load resistances, and biasing components, which can raise the output resistance.
- The exact output resistance can also vary with the **operating point** (collector current \( I_C \)) and **temperature**.

### **Summary**:
For a **2N3904** transistor biased in the active region, the output resistance of an **emitter follower** configuration is typically quite low, on the order of **a few ohms** (often around **0.25 to 1 Î©**). This low output resistance is one of the reasons emitter followers are used as **impedance matching** buffers.
