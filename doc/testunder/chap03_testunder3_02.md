The value of λ = 0 is important because it relates to the **channel-length modulation** effect in MOSFETs. When λ is nonzero, it signifies that there is a small variation in the drain current with changes in the drain-to-source voltage (\( v_{DS} \)) due to the shortening of the effective channel length as \( v_{DS} \) increases. This effect causes a slight increase in current even after the transistor enters saturation.

### THIS ALSO APPLIES TO NMOS DEVICES

In the context of the calculation of the **conduction parameter** \( K_p \), the value of λ doesn't affect the result directly because:

1. **Conduction parameter** \( K_p \) is related to the intrinsic properties of the MOSFET, such as the mobility of the carriers (μp), the oxide capacitance (Cox), and the geometry of the MOSFET (width \( W \) and length \( L \)).

2. **Channel-length modulation** (represented by λ) only affects the **drain current** in the saturation region when a voltage is applied between the drain and the source. It impacts the **saturation current** calculation (i.e., the current when the MOSFET is in saturation) but doesn't impact the basic **conduction parameter** \( K_p \).

   Specifically, λ comes into play when calculating the drain current in saturation, which has a term \( (1 + λ * v_{DS}) \) to account for the slight increase in current due to channel-length modulation.

   The formula for the drain current \( I_D \) in the saturation region is:

   \[
   I_D = K_p * ( v_{SG} - V_{TP} )^2 *( 1 + λ * v_{DS} )
   \]

   However, for the calculation of \( K_p \) alone, we do not consider the effect of λ, because we are focusing on the transistor's intrinsic properties, not the current-voltage relationship in the saturation region.

### Conclusion:
Since λ = 0 in this case, it confirms that the channel-length modulation effect is neglected (i.e., no dependence of current on \( v_{DS} \) beyond the saturation region), and thus, it does not affect the calculation of the conduction parameter \( K_p \). Therefore, λ  is not used in the calculation of \( K_p \).
