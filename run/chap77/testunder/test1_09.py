	"""Page 43:
	Consider the diode and circuit in Exercise EX 1.8.  Determine VD and ID
	using the graphical technique.
	From page 37, exercise 1.8:
	Use iteration to determine the diode voltage and current for the circuit
	per Figure 1.28.  Consider a diode with a given reverse-saturation current
	of IS = 1e-13A.  VPS = V; R=4kÎ©.
	Comment: Once the diode voltage is known, the current can also be determined
	from the ideal diode equation. However, dividing the voltage difference across
	a resistor by the resistance is usually easier, and this approach is used
	extensively in the analysis of diode and transistor circuits.
	Page 37:
	ANS VD ~= 0.54 V, ID ~= 0.87mA.

	See example/doc/exam1_08.docx (because this exercise is essentially the same).

	Solution:
	Use KVL to write the voltage equation around the loop:
		VPS = ID*R + VD
	Then, solve above for ID.

	Note, the diode I-V characteristic == Ideal Diode Equation
			see Chap01.calc_diode_ideal_current( ID, VD ).
