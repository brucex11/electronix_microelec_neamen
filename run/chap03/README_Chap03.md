# Notes
* Pg 126: The `metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor` (MOSFET)
achieved volume production in 1967. The MOSFET, compared to BJTs, are very
small (that is, it occupies a very small area on an IC chip).
* Pg 126: `field effect`: modulate the conductance of a semiconductor, or control
the current in a semiconductor, by applying an electric field perpendicular to
the surface.
* Pg 127: For Fig 3.1, the parameter tox is the thickness of the oxide and
 Îµox is the `oxide permittivity`.
* Pg 127: For an n-channel/type MOSFET, a large, positive gate voltage generates
an `electron inversion layer` inside the channel/substrate against the oxide-layer.
* Pg 128: For a p-channel/type MOSFET, a large, negative gate voltage generates
a `hole inversion layer` inside the channel/substrate against the oxide-layer.
* Pg 128: The magnitude of the charge in the `inversion layer` is a function
of the applied gate voltage.
* Pg 128: The term `enhancement mode` means that a Gate Voltage must be applied
to the gate to create the inversion layer.
* Pg 128: To enable `enhancement mode`, the Gate Voltage must be the
`same polarity` as the channel/substrate.
