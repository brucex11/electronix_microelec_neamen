# Python Project MICROELEC_NEAMEN
# Labs
Figures and notes for all `./subdir` examples, exercises, and problems for this
chapter are contained in MSWord docx located in the `./docx/` folder.
Don't forget to update .gitignore to preclude .docx binaries from repository.

# Search This Document
Use the keywords below for python-code implementations, problems with plots, etc.
When applicable, each problem has keywords that reflect code in that problem.

## Available Keywords
* `impedance_reflection`  `input_resistance`  `output_resistance`


# Solutions
Here is the format for each solution (casc_XX) where `casc` stands-for cascade.

casc_XX: Description
* worked-file
* associated word docx (optional)
* ./LTspice folder (optional)
* keywords list `YYY ZZZ`(optional)


Figures are solutions to figures in the text.  This was inspired by development
of a tool to iterate resistances for simple circuits.  See Fig6_14.

casc_cc: Emitter-follower (CC) stage.
* ./labs/CE_CC_cascade/casc_cc.py
* ./docx/labs/CE-CC_Cascade/LTspice/simulation/CC/
